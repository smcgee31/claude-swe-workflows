# /implement - Automated Development Workflow

## Overview

The `/implement` skill orchestrates a complete development workflow through specialist agents, taking you from requirements to tested, documented, production-ready code. It coordinates implementation, refactoring, quality assurance, and documentation in a systematic, repeatable process.

**Key benefits:**
- Specialist expertise applied to each phase
- Prevents common failure modes (untested code, breaking changes, outdated docs)
- Built-in quality gates and feedback loops
- Language-specific best practices enforced
- Comprehensive but efficient (agents skip unnecessary work)

## When to Use

**Use `/implement` for:**
- Non-trivial features requiring multiple files or subsystems
- Bug fixes where you want comprehensive testing and documentation
- Changes where quality gates matter (refactoring, security, performance)
- Work that benefits from specialist review (GraphQL APIs, Docker, Makefiles)
- Features where practical verification is important (CLI tools, MCP servers)

**Don't use `/implement` for:**
- Simple typo fixes or trivial one-line changes
- Quick exploratory work or prototyping
- Tasks where overhead outweighs benefit
- Work you'll throw away or iterate on rapidly

**Rule of thumb:** If the task is substantial enough that you'd normally write tests, update docs, and get a code review, use `/implement`.

## Workflow Details

### 1. Requirements Clarification
The workflow starts by ensuring requirements are clear and unambiguous. The orchestrator asks clarifying questions about:
- What feature/bug/change is requested
- Acceptance criteria (how do we know it works?)
- Constraints or preferences

This step loops until requirements are crystal clear.

### 2. Planning (Conditional)
For complex tasks, the `swe-planner` agent creates a structured implementation plan:
- **Complex tasks** needing planning: architectural changes, migrations, cross-cutting concerns, multi-module features
- **Simple tasks** skip planning: bug fixes, single-file changes, straightforward CRUD

The planner produces ordered sub-tasks with What/Why/How/Verify/Risks for each step.

### 3. Implementation
A language-specific specialist (or generalist) implements the feature:
- Follows language idioms and best practices
- Writes unit tests for pure functions (TDD encouraged)
- Handles edge cases and errors
- Follows the plan if one exists

**Specialists available:**
- `swe-sme-golang` - Go projects
- `swe-sme-graphql` - GraphQL schemas/resolvers
- `swe-sme-docker` - Dockerfiles and containers
- `swe-sme-makefile` - Makefiles and build systems
- `swe-sme-ansible` - Ansible playbooks and roles
- `swe-sme-zig` - Zig projects

### 4. Quality Assurance - Acceptance Verification (CRITICAL GATE)
The `qa-engineer` performs practical verification before writing tests:
- **CLI tools**: Run commands in subshell
- **MCP servers**: Spawn Claude subagent to test
- **APIs**: Make actual calls
- **Libraries**: Test with realistic usage

Only after confirming the feature works does it write unit tests. This prevents "passing tests for broken code."

**Failure mode prevented:**
```
❌ Old workflow: Write code → Write passing tests → Ship broken code
✅ New workflow: Write code → Actually run it → Then write tests
```

If verification fails, returns to implementation (max 3 attempts).

**Key insight:** Don't proceed to code review until we know the code actually works.

### 5. Code Review (Conditional Reviewers)

**Only review working code.** If acceptance verification failed, we never get here.

All reviewers run conditionally based on code changes and provide feedback. The implementation agent responds to all feedback in step 6.

**5a. Security Review (Has Authority):**
If security-sensitive code changed (auth, crypto, input validation):
- `sec-reviewer` analyzes for vulnerabilities
- Checks for OWASP top 10 issues
- **Has authority to demand changes** - critical/high severity findings must be addressed or require explicit user approval

**5b. Refactoring Review (Advisory):**
If non-trivial implementation (>50 lines, multiple files, complex logic):
- `swe-refactor` analyzes code quality
- Identifies DRY violations, dead code, complexity
- Provides recommendations (advisory only)

**5c. Performance Review (Advisory):**
If performance-critical code changed (hot paths, loops, DB queries):
- `swe-perf-engineer` runs benchmarks and profiling
- Identifies bottlenecks
- Provides optimization recommendations (advisory only)

### 6. Implement Review Feedback

The implementation agent (same as step 3) receives all review feedback and responds:
- **Security findings**: Must address or get explicit user approval to skip
- **Other feedback**: Advisory - agent uses discretion
- Specialists can decline recommendations based on language idioms
- Example: Go agent may decline "extract helper" if Go culture prefers "a little copying"

All accepted changes are implemented and committed.

### 7. SME Peer Review (Conditional)

A fresh instance of the same SME type (with a clean context window) reviews the work:
- **Condition**: Non-trivial changes (>50 lines, multiple files, or complex logic)
- **Skip if**: Changes are trivial or no language-specific SME was used

**The "fresh eyes" principle:**
- The original SME accumulates context and justifications that can create blind spots
- A fresh SME sees only the current code state via git diff
- Reviews with "would I accept this PR" lens

**Scope (critical constraints):**
- Small cleanups and nits only
- No architectural changes or re-implementing features
- No changing approaches chosen by original SME
- If something seems wrong at a deeper level, flag it rather than fix it

**Has authority to make small fixes directly** - this is efficient for nits. If peer review changes break tests, they're reverted (nits aren't worth breaking functionality).

### 8. Quality Assurance - Coverage & Quality

General QA assessment of test coverage, linters, and code quality:
- Assesses coverage for all changed code (from steps 3, 6, and 7)
- Fills coverage gaps
- Runs linters/formatters
- **Verifies steps 6 and 7 changes didn't break tests** - catches bad refactors, security fixes, or peer review issues

If tests are broken by changes from step 6, returns to step 6. If broken by step 7, reverts peer review changes. Minor issues don't block workflow.

### 9. Documentation
The `doc-maintainer` updates affected documentation:
- README.md for user-facing changes
- CLAUDE.md for architectural changes
- API docs for interface changes
- Verifies code examples still work

Targeted review (not comprehensive audit).

### 10. Final Verification
Comprehensive checks before presenting to user:
- Full test suite passes
- All linters pass
- No new warnings
- Git status clean

Presents summary: files changed, tests added, coverage improvements, TODOs.

### 11. Workflow Completion (Optional)
After presenting the summary, asks if you want to complete the workflow. If yes, performs housekeeping:

**Commit changes:**
- Creates commit with descriptive message
- References ticket number if available
- Includes Co-Authored-By: Claude line

**Update/close ticket (if applicable):**
- Detects platform integration
- Extracts ticket number from branch name or asks user
- Posts summary comment
- Optionally closes ticket

**Sync with main (if applicable):**
- Checks if branch is behind main
- Offers to rebase on main
- Reports conflicts if any arise

Presents final status showing what was completed.

## Examples

### Example 1: Adding a Feature to a Go CLI Tool
```
User: "Add a --format flag to support JSON and YAML output"

Workflow:
1. Clarify: Output format for what command? Default behavior?
2. Plan: Skip (straightforward feature)
3. Implement: swe-sme-golang adds flag, implements formatters, writes tests
4. QA (acceptance): qa-engineer runs CLI with --format json and --format yaml,
                   verifies output actually works, writes additional test cases
5. Review: swe-refactor suggests extracting common formatting logic
          (security/performance reviews skipped - not applicable)
6. Respond: swe-sme-golang reviews refactoring suggestions, implements extraction
7. Peer review: Fresh swe-sme-golang reviews, fixes minor naming inconsistency
8. QA (coverage): Checks coverage, runs linters, verifies changes didn't break tests
9. Docs: doc-maintainer updates README with --format examples
10. Verify: All tests pass, present summary
11. Complete: User confirms, commits changes, skips ticket update, branch already up to date
```

### Example 2: GraphQL API with Security Concerns
```
User: "Add user mutation with password reset capability"

Workflow:
1. Clarify: Email verification required? Token expiration? Rate limiting?
2. Plan: swe-planner creates plan (mutation, resolver, email service, rate limiter)
3. Implement: swe-sme-graphql implements following plan, writes resolver tests
4. QA (acceptance): qa-engineer spawns test agent, actually tests password reset
                    flow end-to-end, verifies feature works
5. Review: sec-reviewer finds timing attack vulnerability, recommends constant-time comparison
          swe-refactor suggests extracting email service
          (performance reviews skipped - not applicable)
6. Respond: swe-sme-graphql addresses security issue (must fix), implements email extraction
7. Peer review: Fresh swe-sme-graphql reviews, cleans up error message formatting
8. QA (coverage): Coverage check, linters, verify changes didn't break tests
9. Docs: Updates API docs with mutation examples
10. Verify: All checks pass
11. Complete: User confirms, commits changes with "Fixes #456", updates and closes ticket,
             rebases on main
```

### Example 3: Simple Bug Fix
```
User: "Fix off-by-one error in pagination"

Workflow:
1. Clarify: Which pagination function? Expected behavior?
2. Plan: Skip (simple fix)
3. Implement: Fix error, add test case
4. QA (acceptance): Actually runs pagination, verifies correct behavior
5. Review: swe-refactor finds no issues (all other reviews skipped)
6. Respond: Skip (no feedback to implement)
7. Peer review: Skip (trivial change)
8. QA (coverage): Coverage check
9. Docs: doc-maintainer finds no docs affected
10. Verify: Tests pass
11. Complete: User declines, will commit manually later
```

## Tips for Effective Use

1. **Be specific with requirements**: The clearer your requirements, the better the output. Specify acceptance criteria upfront.

2. **Trust the specialists**: If a specialist declines a refactoring recommendation, they likely have a good reason (language idioms, design decisions).

3. **Let agents skip work**: Agents are designed to skip unnecessary work. Don't worry if doc-maintainer reports "no docs affected" - that's efficient.

4. **Watch for iteration loops**: If QA verification fails 3 times, there's likely a deeper issue. The workflow will escalate to you for guidance.

5. **Use for the right tasks**: This workflow is heavyweight by design. Don't use it for quick experiments or throwaway code.

6. **Leverage planning for complex work**: If you're unsure how to approach a task, let the planner think it through first.

7. **Practical verification is key**: The workflow specifically prevents "works in tests but not in reality" - agents actually run the code.

## Agent Coordination

All agents run **sequentially** (never in parallel):
- Each agent completes before the next starts
- State is preserved and passed between agents
- Feedback loops return to earlier steps when needed
- Max 3 iterations for acceptance verification before escalation

## Iteration Limits

**Safety limits:**
- Acceptance verification loop: 3 attempts max
- Overall workflow: 10 agent spawns max

If limits reached, workflow escalates to user with current state and specific blockers.

## Philosophy

The `/implement` workflow embodies several key principles:

**Different lenses, different stages:**
- Implementation focuses on "does it work?"
- Acceptance QA focuses on "does it actually work in practice?"
- Review phase focuses on multiple concerns (security, quality, performance) - all reviewers provide feedback on working code
- Response phase focuses on "how should we address feedback?" - implementation agent uses discretion
- Peer review focuses on "would I accept this PR?" - fresh eyes catch what accumulated context misses
- Coverage QA focuses on "did our changes break anything?"
- Documentation focuses on "can others understand it?"

**Specialists have final say:**
- Language SMEs make language-specific decisions
- Generalist code review provides perspective
- Specialists can decline recommendations that don't fit

**Practical verification over test-passing:**
- Actually run the feature before trusting tests
- Prevents false confidence from passing tests

**Efficient thoroughness:**
- Comprehensive when needed, but agents skip unnecessary work
- Not every task needs security review or performance testing
- Conditional specialist invocation based on code changes
