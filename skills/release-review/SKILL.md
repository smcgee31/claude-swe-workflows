# Release Review - Pre-Release Readiness Check

Interactive pre-flight checklist before cutting a release. Spawns a scanner agent for static analysis, runs execution-based checks (tests, build, doc freshness), and presents consolidated findings for human review. Releases are important milestones — this workflow keeps the human tightly in the loop.

## Philosophy

**Surface issues, don't silently fix them.** A release is a commitment to users. Every issue deserves human review before shipping. The only auto-fixes offered are mechanical debug artifact removals.

**Fast feedback first.** Run cheap static analysis before expensive execution checks. If there are obvious blockers, the user should know before waiting for a full test suite.

**Err toward reporting.** A false positive costs seconds. A missed issue ships to users.

## Workflow Details

### 1. Determine Release Context

**Detect automatically:**
- Last tag: `git describe --tags --abbrev=0` (if no tags, note this)
- Project type and language from manifest files
- Test command (detect from Makefile, package.json, go.mod, Cargo.toml, pyproject.toml, etc.)
- Build command (detect from Makefile, package.json, go.mod, Cargo.toml, pyproject.toml, etc.)

**Ask the user two questions:**

1. "What version are you releasing?" (Optional — enables version consistency checking against a target. If the user skips this, still check that all discovered versions agree with each other.)

2. "Any checks you want to skip?" Present options:
   - **Run everything** (Recommended)
   - **Skip build verification** (if no build step, or build is very slow)
   - **Skip doc freshness check**
   - **Skip license compliance**

### 2. Spawn qa-release-eng Agent

**Prompt:**
```
Perform a release readiness scan of this codebase.
Last tag: [tag or "none"]
Target version: [version if provided, else "not specified"]
Scope: entire codebase

Scan for: debug artifacts, version consistency, changelog coverage,
git hygiene, breaking changes, license compliance.

Return structured findings with severity levels (BLOCKER/WARNING/INFO).
```

### 3. Present Phase 1 Findings

Display the agent's findings grouped by severity:

```
## Release Readiness: Static Analysis

Last tag: v1.2.3 → Target: v1.3.0
47 commits, 23 files changed

### BLOCKERS (must fix before release)
1. [GIT] src/auth.go:42 — Merge conflict markers found
2. [DEBUG] src/api/handler.go:15 — console.log("debug request body")
3. [VERSION] package.json says 1.2.3, src/version.go says 1.2.2

### WARNINGS (should review)
4. [CHANGELOG] CHANGELOG.md not updated since v1.2.3
5. [DEBUG] src/utils.go:88 — TODO: refactor this before release
6. [LICENSE] New dependency 'foo-lib' has unknown license

### PASSED
- Git hygiene: No large binaries, no tracked secrets
- Breaking changes: No public API removals detected
```

### 4. User Decision Point

**Ask the user:** "Continue with execution checks (tests, build, docs)? These may take a while."

Present options:
- **Continue**: Proceed with test suite, build verification, doc freshness
- **Fix blockers first**: Stop here, address blockers, then re-run `/release-review`
- **Skip to selection**: Go directly to item selection without running execution checks

This pause is important. If there are clear blockers, there's no point waiting for a full test suite.

### 5. Run Test Suite

**Detect test command** (try in order):
1. `Makefile` with `test` target → `make test`
2. `package.json` with `test` script → `npm test`
3. `go.mod` present → `go test ./...`
4. `Cargo.toml` → `cargo test`
5. `pyproject.toml` or `setup.py` → `pytest` or `python -m pytest`
6. If none detected, ask the user

**Run the test command.** Report:
- PASS → add as INFO: "Test suite: all tests pass"
- FAIL → add as BLOCKER with failure summary (which tests failed, error output)

### 6. Run Build Verification

**Skip if user opted out in step 1.**

**Detect build command** (try in order):
1. `Makefile` with `build` target → `make build`
2. `package.json` with `build` script → `npm run build`
3. `go.mod` present → `go build ./...`
4. `Cargo.toml` → `cargo build --release`
5. `pyproject.toml` with build config → detect build tool (`python -m build`, `poetry build`, etc.)
6. If none detected, skip with INFO: "No build command detected, skipping build verification"

**Run the build command.** Report:
- PASS → add as INFO: "Build: clean build successful"
- FAIL → add as BLOCKER with error output

### 7. Check Documentation Freshness

**Skip if user opted out in step 1.**

**Spawn `doc-maintainer` agent** in assessment-only mode:

```
Perform a documentation freshness assessment only. DO NOT make any changes.
Review all documentation files (README, CHANGELOG, CLAUDE.md, doc/, etc.)
for staleness relative to the current codebase.
Report which documents appear outdated and what specifically seems wrong.
```

**Add findings as WARNINGs.** Include a note: "Run `/doc-review` to update documentation before release."

### 8. Present Full Consolidated Report

Merge all findings from steps 2-7 into a single numbered list:

```
## Release Readiness Report

Target: v1.3.0 (from v1.2.3, 47 commits)

### BLOCKERS (3)
1. [GIT] src/auth.go:42 — Merge conflict markers
2. [DEBUG] src/api/handler.go:15 — console.log("debug request body")
3. [TESTS] 2 test failures: TestPaymentFlow, TestAuthRefresh

### WARNINGS (4)
4. [CHANGELOG] Not updated since v1.2.3
5. [DEBUG] TODO markers in 3 files
6. [LICENSE] New dependency 'foo-lib' — unknown license
7. [DOCS] README.md references removed function parseConfig()

### PASSED
- Version consistency: All manifests agree (1.3.0)
- Build: Clean build successful
- Git hygiene: No large binaries, no tracked secrets
- Breaking changes: No undocumented API changes

Select items to address (e.g., "1-3", "all blockers", "all"):
```

**Use `AskUserQuestion`** with multi-select. Support shortcuts: "all blockers", "all warnings", "all", or specific numbers.

### 9. Implement Selected Fixes

Group selected items by type and handle appropriately:

#### Debug artifact removal (auto-fixable)
Handle directly as orchestrator. Remove the debug statement/line. Show the user what was removed.

#### TODO/FIXME markers (auto-fixable if selected)
Remove the marker comment. Show what was removed. The user selected these knowing they'd be deleted.

#### Merge conflict markers
Cannot auto-fix — the user must resolve conflicts manually. Report the file and conflicting content. Skip.

#### Test failures
Cannot auto-fix from here. Suggest: "Test failures require investigation. Fix manually or use `/implement` to address."

#### Build failures
Cannot auto-fix from here. Report the error and suggest investigating.

#### Changelog gaps
Cannot auto-generate meaningful entries. Offer to scaffold a changelog entry by listing commits since last tag, organized by type (features, fixes, etc.). The user fills in the details.

#### Version mismatches
If the user provided a target version, offer to update version numbers in manifest files to match. This is mechanical and safe for manifests. For source code constants, show the file and line — the user confirms.

#### License issues
Report only. The user must decide whether the dependency is acceptable.

#### Doc staleness
Suggest running `/doc-review`. Do not attempt fixes.

#### Breaking changes
Report only. The user must decide whether to document, revert, or accept.

### 10. Re-verify Affected Checks

After implementing fixes, re-verify only the checks that were affected:

- Debug artifacts removed → quick Grep to confirm none remain
- Version numbers updated → re-check consistency
- If nothing else changed, skip re-verification

Do NOT re-run the full test suite or build at this step (the user can do that separately). Only re-verify the fast, static checks.

### 11. Final Summary

```
## Release Review Complete

### Status
- BLOCKERS resolved: 2/3 (1 requires manual fix)
- WARNINGS addressed: 2/4
- Items skipped: 3 (user declined)

### Changes Made
- Removed 1 console.log statement (src/api/handler.go:15)
- Removed 3 TODO markers

### Remaining Issues
- [BLOCKER] Merge conflict markers in src/auth.go — manual resolution needed
- [WARNING] CHANGELOG.md not updated
- [WARNING] New dependency 'foo-lib' license unverified

### Recommendation
HOLD — 1 unresolved BLOCKER remains
```

**Recommendation logic:**
- **HOLD**: Any unresolved BLOCKERs
- **PROCEED WITH CAUTION**: Only WARNINGs remain
- **READY TO RELEASE**: No BLOCKERs or WARNINGs

**If changes were made**, ask the user if they want to commit:

```bash
git add [specific files modified]
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
chore: pre-release cleanup

```

## Agent Coordination

**Sequential execution:**
- One agent at a time
- Wait for completion before spawning next

**Agents used:**
- `qa-release-eng`: Static analysis scan (step 2)
- `doc-maintainer`: Documentation freshness assessment only (step 7)

**State to maintain (as orchestrator):**
- Release context (last tag, target version, skipped checks)
- Agent findings (from qa-release-eng)
- Execution check results (tests, build, docs)
- Consolidated finding list with numbering
- User selections
- Fix results
- Running totals for summary

## Abort Conditions

**Abort workflow:**
- User interrupts
- Not a git repository
- No permission to run test/build commands

**Do NOT abort for:**
- No tags found (use initial commit as baseline, note in report)
- Individual check failures (report and continue)
- Agent finding no issues (exit gracefully — "Release looks clean")
- Test or build failures (report as BLOCKERs, continue with other checks)

## Test/Build Command Detection

**Test commands** (try in order):
1. `Makefile` with `test` target → `make test`
2. `package.json` with `test` script → `npm test`
3. `go.mod` → `go test ./...`
4. `Cargo.toml` → `cargo test`
5. `pyproject.toml` or `setup.py` → `pytest`
6. Ask user if none detected

**Build commands** (try in order):
1. `Makefile` with `build` target → `make build`
2. `package.json` with `build` script → `npm run build`
3. `go.mod` → `go build ./...`
4. `Cargo.toml` → `cargo build --release`
5. `pyproject.toml` with build config → `python -m build`
6. Skip with INFO if none detected
